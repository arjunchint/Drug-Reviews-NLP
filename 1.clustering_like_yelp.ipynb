For two days, he could hardly get out of bed, was very cranky, and slept for nearly 8 hours on a drive home from school vacation (very unusual for him.) I called his doctor on Monday morning and she said to stick it out a few days. See how he did at school, and with getting up in the morning. The last two days have been problem free. He is MUCH more agreeable than ever. He is less emotional (a good thing), less cranky. He is remembering all the things he should. Overall his behavior is better. \\r\\nWe have tried many different medications and so far this is the most effective.\"',\n",

But it contained hormone gestodene, which is not available in US, so I switched to Lybrel, because the ingredients are similar. When my other pills ended, I started Lybrel immediately, on my first day of period, as the instructions said. And the period lasted for two weeks. When taking the second pack- same two weeks. And now, with third pack things got even worse- my third period lasted for two weeks and now it&#039;s the end of the third week- I still have daily brown discharge.\\r\\nThe positive side is that I didn&#039;t have any other side effects. The idea of being period free was so tempting... Alas.\"',\n",

Every time I went to the Dr. It was adjusted, it could not regulate me and most Dr&#039;s. Just played with raising and lowering the mg levels. \\r\\nFinally a person I new told me I should see her Dr. I did, and that was the beginning of a beautiful relationship with Armour Thyroid. I&#039;ve never felt better,  my bad symptoms went away, and I feel almost human. It holds me steady for longer periods. sometimes the patient knows best, regardless of what the blood tests say.

Lot of it could be in my head but trust me all my symptoms disappeared. Side effects: from day one I had a light headache, day two -a little harder headache, day three unbearable headache, day four(now) no headache, feeling perfectly fine, great mood, even though its raining and dark outside.  GREAT medicine. Also its worth to add, it worked the same wonders for me about 8 years ago when I had it for the last time. I was on Paxil for 6 months and it healed me. I had 7 years of great life and suddenly 6-7 months ago this thing attacked me again. Paxil works again, same way.\"\n",

Well, not too long after that, I desperately needed to be put on Testosterone therapy (my level was &#039;zilch&#039;). Lo-and-behold, it had JUST been determined that MEN should NOT take large doses of melatonin for that very reason!\r\n",
