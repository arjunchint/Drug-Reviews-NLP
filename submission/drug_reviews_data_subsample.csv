Mirtazapine,Depression,"""I&#039;ve tried a few antidepressants over the years (citalopram, fluoxetine, amitriptyline), but none of those helped with my depression, insomnia &amp; anxiety. My doctor suggested and changed me onto 45mg mirtazapine and this medicine has saved my life. Thankfully I have had no side effects especially the most common - weight gain, I&#039;ve actually lost alot of weight. I still have suicidal thoughts but mirtazapine has saved me.""",10,2/28/2012,22
Mesalamine,"Crohn's Disease, Maintenance","""My son has Crohn&#039;s disease and has done very well on the Asacol.  He has no complaints and shows no side effects.  He has taken as many as nine tablets per day at one time.  I&#039;ve been very happy with the results, reducing his bouts of diarrhea drastically.""",8,5/17/2009,17
Bactrim,Urinary Tract Infection,"""Quick reduction of symptoms""",9,9/29/2017,3
Contrave,Weight Loss,"""Contrave combines drugs that were used for alcohol, smoking, and opioid cessation. People lose weight on it because it also helps control over-eating. I have no doubt that most obesity is caused from sugar/carb addiction, which is just as powerful as any drug. I have been taking it for five days, and the good news is, it seems to go to work immediately. I feel hungry before I want food now. I really don&#039;t care to eat; it&#039;s just to fill my stomach. Since I have only been on it a few days, I don&#039;t know if I&#039;ve lost weight (I don&#039;t have a scale), but my clothes do feel a little looser, so maybe a pound or two. I&#039;m hoping that after a few months on this medication, I will develop healthier habits that I can continue without the aid of Contrave.""",9,3/5/2017,35
Cyclafem 1 / 35,Birth Control,"""I have been on this birth control for one cycle. After reading some of the reviews on this type and similar birth controls I was a bit apprehensive to start. Im giving this birth control a 9 out of 10 as I have not been on it long enough for a 10. So far I love this birth control! My side effects have been so minimal its like Im not even on birth control! I have experienced mild headaches here and there and some nausea but other than that ive been feeling great! I got my period on cue on the third day of the inactive pills and I had no idea it was coming because I had zero pms! My period was very light and I barely had any cramping! I had unprotected sex the first month and obviously didn&#039;t get pregnant so I&#039;m very pleased! Highly recommend""",9,10/22/2015,4
Zyclara,Keratosis,"""4 days in on first 2 weeks.  Using on arms and face. Put vaseline on lips, under eyes and in nostrils to protect from cream.  So far no reaction at all.  I know I have many pre cancer and thought I would light up like a Christmas tree but so far so good.  Maybe it&#039;s coming but time will tell.""",4,7/3/2014,13
Copper,Birth Control,"""I&#039;ve had the copper coil for about 3 months now. I was really excited at the thought of not taking hormones. I&#039;m good with pain however I nearly fainted with insertion, couldn&#039;t belive how painful it was; the doctor did say it is very painful for some. Well 3 months in, my periods last 11 days and I&#039;m in pain for about 15 days with random twangs especially in the left side and I&#039;m considering whether I want to put up with the intense pain and heavy periods. I&#039;d recommend this 100% to somebody who doesn&#039;t already have heavy painful periods but right now it just isn&#039;t for me""",6,6/6/2016,1
Amitriptyline,Migraine Prevention,"""This has been great for me. I&#039;ve been on it for 2 weeks and in the last week I only had 3 headaches which went away with 2 Tylenol. I was having chronic daily headaches that wouldn&#039;t go away no matter what I took. I&#039;m still a little sleepy during the day, but I know that will get better. I take 10mg at night.""",9,4/21/2009,32
Methadone,Opiate Withdrawal,"""Ive been on Methadone for over ten years and currently,I am trying to get off of this drug. Ive been decreasing my does 2 mgs per month for over a year. I am at 3 mgs and really starting to feel the withdraw.I don&#039;t plan to get my next 30 doses.because its almost rediculous how little it does for me. I have 3 does doses of 3 mg and Im terrified. Can anyone give me some truthful encouragement?.....""",7,10/18/2016,21
Levora,Birth Control,"""I was on this pill for almost two years. It does work as far as not getting pregnant however my experience at first was it didn&#039;t make a huge difference then 6 or 7 months into it my sex drive went down, along with being very very dry, my moodiness increased drastically. I would cry one second and then get angry with my husband over anything and everything. My skin has gotten a lot worse, I broke out in places I never had in the last week. So now I am on Yaz.""",2,4/16/2011,3
Paroxetine,Hot Flashes,"""Holy Hell is exactly how I feel. I had been taking Brisdelle for 1.5 years. The hot flashes did indeed subside - however, the side affects of this medicine coupled with the fact Noven was acquired by YET another pharmaceutical company - YOU CAN&#039;T PLACE A REP IN THE AREA, DISTRIBUTE YOUR DRUGS, AND THEN FIRE HER-AND NOT REPLACE THEREFORE there is NO medicine or support here. You dumped this drug in the Dr&#039;s hands and walked away. After calling Sebula - you act like you don&#039;t even care. You have made it impossible to obtain this. I happen to think this is illegal.  I just decided to wean myself off this and Premarin. It has been nothing short of a nightmare. If you don&#039;t need this drug- DON&#039;T START. Seriously.""",1,2/22/2017,17
Miconazole,Vaginal Yeast Infection,"""Honestly its day one on the 3 day treatment. Yes it burns a bit and it does leak out if you dont lay down after insertion. But im faithful it will work.""",6,5/7/2015,7
Belviq,Weight Loss,"""This is a waste of money.  Did not curb my appetite nor did it make me feel full.""",1,9/23/2014,57
Seroquel,Schizoaffective Disorde,"""No problems, watch what you eat.""",10,10/8/2014,19
Ambien,Insomnia,"""Ditto on rebound sleepless when discontinued. I have done very strange things with no memory including taking additional Ambien. It has helped me sleep when under extreme stress but watch out. Now I am trying to learn how to sleep naturally.""",2,1/13/2015,44
Nuvigil,Narcolepsy,"""A doctor in the ER prescribed me 200 mg of Provigil when I was first diagnosed with Narcolepsy. It didn&#039;t seem to have any effect on me at all. Then I went to see my sleep doctor and he prescribed me 250 mg of Nuvigil. It finally allowed me to stay awake for an entire day. But if I went out somewhere I would be able to come home and take a nap and be fully awake again. Taking that with Xyrem makes me feel 98%..not quite 100, but still pretty great.""",9,6/30/2010,14
Chantix,Smoking Cessation,"""I smoked for 50+ years.  Took it for one week and that was it.  I didn&#039;t think it was possible for me to quit.  It has been 6 years now.  Great product.""",10,2/14/2015,26
Microgestin Fe 1 / 20,Acne,"""So I was on Ginanvi for about 3 months before I switched over to this pill due to the high cost of Ginavi (I don&#039;t have insurance). Ginanvi had cleared up my acne in the short time I used and I was hoping this birth control would not mess that up. I was wrong. After 2-3 months of using this pill my skin went crazy with horrible breakouts. Now, 9 months later I still have horrible acne. If you want a pill that helps with acne this is NOT it. It also made my period &quot;weird&quot;. I would have little to no period one month and a heavy one the next . The month that I had a heavier flow my boobs would hurt a lot. I also noticed that at the beginning of taking it , I would be moody and extremely irritable all the time . It&#039;s time for me to switch.""",3,6/22/2017,1
Klonopin,Bipolar Disorde,"""This medication helped me  sleep, but eventually it became ineffective as a sleep aid. It also helps me calm down when in severe stress, anxiety, or panic.""",6,7/14/2009,24
Ethinyl estradiol / norelgestromin,Birth Control,"""This is my first time using any form of birth control. I&#039;m glad I went with the patch, I have been on it for 8 months. At first It decreased my libido but that subsided. The only downside is that it made my periods longer (5-6 days to be exact) I used to only have periods for 3-4 days max also made my cramps intense for the first two days of my period, I never had cramps before using birth control. Other than that in happy with the patch""",8,11/3/2015,10
Omnicef,Otitis Media,"""My son who just turned one year old was prescribed this medication after 2 medications prior did not work to cure his ear infection. I was skeptical of using this medication at first but after the desired result was achieved I certainly do not regret it.""",10,4/13/2009,15
Sprintec,Birth Control,"""This is only my second week taking it  and I take it at night but right after I eat I get nauseous. My breast were sore but that went away. The only problem I&#039;m having is my period. It usually only last about 4 days but it&#039;s going on the 8th day now. Maybe I have to get used to it first.""",8,3/13/2014,1
Varenicline,Smoking Cessation,"""I have been a pack a day smoker for over 20 years. Previuosly I&#039;ve quit successfully on the patch and Zyban. Recently, I had a dream that I was told I had lung cancer and it was so vivid I called my doctor and started taking Chantix. It&#039;s now week 5 and I&#039;m smoke free and feel great. Only side affects are ocasional nausea and vivid dreams, ironic and no problem. You still have to be motivated to get past the cravings, but Chantix takes the Nicotine punch out of quitting so its bearable. """,9,7/4/2008,16
